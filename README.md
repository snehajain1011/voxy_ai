# Voxy AI

Voxy AI is a full-stack, self-hosted application designed to implement advanced AI-powered audio generation capabilities.

## Features

* **Generate Speech from Text (Text-to-Speech):** Convert written text into natural-sounding audio.
* **Change Voices (Voice Conversion):** Transform an existing audio clip from one voice to another.
* **Generate Sound Effects:** Create custom sound effects from descriptive text prompts.

I spent a summer building this project. I spent time researching papers on which models I should use and entire planning.
